This developer manual essentially divided into frontend and backend.

The instructions are for the corresponding repositories:

- Frontend: [Dashboard](https://github.com/social-gissy-network/dashboard)
- Backend: [Core](https://github.com/social-gissy-network/core)

Note that in this manual we'll use the [Hubway](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hubway-data/index.html) dataset for examples.

You can choose which dataset you want to load into the system, as long it accomplishes the dataset constrains.

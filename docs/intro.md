## Description

Given a large set of geographical entities (nodes on a map) and a list of routes traveling between these nodes infer possible relations between these entities and visualize these relations in a graphical UI.

You will be expected to collect the data set (which may be large), store the data
(possibly using a graph database), provide a way for the user to query the data and
visualize it.

The project needs to be built as a set of reusable components that can later be
integrated into other projects. You will use the Micro-services approach and Web
Components to achieve this goal.
